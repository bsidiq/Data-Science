    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run codes, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n"

    "For this part, we're going to explore some new somewhat strange syntax that we haven't seen in lecture. Don't panic! If you're not sure what to do, try experimenting, Googling, and don't shy away from talking to other students or course staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem we'll use the time component of the inspection data.  All of this information is given in the `date` column of the `ins` dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1:** What is the type of the individual `ins['date']` entries? You may want to grab the very first entry and use the `type` function in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2:** Rather than the type you discovered in Part 1, we want each entry in `pd.TimeStamp` format. You might expect that the usual way to convert something from it current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime`. Using `pd.to_datetime`, create a new `ins['timestamp']` column containing `pd.Timestamp` objects.  These will allow us to do date manipulation with much greater ease in part 3 and part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3:** What are the earliest and latest dates in our inspection data?  *Hint: you can use `min` and `max` on dates of the correct type.*\n",

    "**Part 4:** We probably want to examine the inspections by year. Create an additional `ins['year']` column containing just the year of the inspection.  Consider using `pd.Series.dt.year` to do this.\n",

    "\n",
    "The city would like to know if food safety inspections work. This is a pretty vague and broad question. Such questions are common in the field of data science! \n",
    "\n",
    "In part 6b and 6c we'll explore one possible way to explore this question just using the data we have available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll ask: What's the relationship between the first and second scores for the businesses with 2 inspections in a year? Do they typically improve? What can we say about restaurants that initially failed? For simplicity, let's focus on only 2018 for this problem, using the `ins2018` DataFrame that will be created for you below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we create a DataFrame called `scores_pairs_by_business` indexed by `bid` (containing only businesses with exactly 2 inspections in 2018). This DataFrame contains the field score_pair consisting of the score pairs ordered chronologically: `[first_score, second_score]`."
